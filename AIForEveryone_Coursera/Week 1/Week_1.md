### Week 1 - Introduction

- The course teaches how to navigate the rise of AI, even if you are non technical.
- Realistic view of AI.
- AI is 2 seperate ideas: articial narrow intelligence (ANI) and artificial general intelligence (AGI).
- AGI = superintelligence - perhaps?
- ANI = AI that does one thing such as a smart speaker.

### Machine Learning

- Machine learning is a key tool in AI that learns A to B, or input to output mappings.
- The most commonly used type of machine learning is supervised learning, where the input is mapped to the output.
- Supervised learning has been around for decades but has taken off in recent years due to the rise of neural networks and deep learning.
- With modern AI, larger amounts of data can be processed more accurately, making AI systems more valuable.
- Having lots of data and being able to train a very large neural network achieves the best performance.
- The internet allows reach for more data.

### What is data?

- Data is crucial for building Ai and machine learning systems.
- Data can be represented in the form of a dataset.
- A dataset can have multiple inputs (A) and outputs (B) depending on the business use case.
- Examples of datasets include house prices, cat recognition, and machine failures.
- Data can be acquired through manual labeling, observing user/machine behaviors, or downloading from websites/partners.
- The internet provides access to many datasets for various applications.

### AI Terminology

Machine Learning:

- A type of AI system that learns input to output mappings, or A to B mappings.
- It results in a running AI system that can automatically input A and output B.
- Serves dozens or hundreds of thousands of millions of users.

Data Science:

- The science of extracting knowledge and insights from data.
- The output of a data science project is often a slide deck, a PowerPoint presentation, that summarizes conclusions for executives to take business actions.

Machine Learning vs. Data Science:

- The boundaries between the two terms are fuzzy, and the terms are not used consistently even in industry today.
- Machine learning gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
- Data science extracts knowledge and insights from data.

Deep Learning:

- An effective way to predict housing prices given input A is to feed it to a neural network.
- A neural network takes input A and outputs the estimated price of the house.
- All of human cognition is made up of neurons in the brain passing electrical impulses to each other.

### What makes an AI company?

- Good at strategic data acquisation.
- Have a unified data warehouse.
- Are good at spotting automation oppourtunities.
- Have many new roles such as MLE.
- Continous learning: AI is a rapidly evolving field, and an AI company must continously learn and adapt to stay up to date.
- Have a strong data infrastructure.

### What machine learning can and cannot do

- Technical diligence is necessary before committing to a specific AI project to ensure its feasibility.
- Some CEOs can have inflated expectations of AI, leading to asking for things that current AI cannot do.
- One imperfect rule of thumb for deciding what supervised learning can do is if it takes less than a second of human thought to accomplish.
- With a small dataset of only 1,000 examples, an AI system may generate the same simple response to all customer emails or even gibberish.
