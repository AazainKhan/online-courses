### Week 2 Introduction

- An AI project has a sequence of predictable steps.
- Will learn the workflow of an AI project.
- Learn how to organise data for executing on an AI project.
- Framework for brainstorming.

### Workflow of a machine learning project

- Machine learning algorithms can learn input to output or A to B mappings.
- The workflow of a machine learning project involves three main steps: collecting data, training the model, and deploying the model.
- Deploying the model involves putting the AI software into a device and testing it with users, which may require further iteration and updating based on user feedback.
- The same workflow applies to different machine learning projects, such as building a speech recognition system or a self-driving car's object detection algorithm.

### Workflow of a datascience project

- The output of a data science project is often a set of actionable insights that may cause organizations to make changes.
- The key steps of a data science project are to collect data, analyze data, suggest hypotheses and actions, and then reanalyze the data periodically.
- A good data science team will iterate many times to get good insights and will distill these insights down to a smaller number of hypotheses and suggested actions.

### Every job function needs to learn how to use data

- Data is transforming many different job functions
- Digitization of society has made data available in digital format
- Tools like data science or machine learning can help job functions
- Where data science and machine learning can be applied:
    - Sales: machine learning can help prioritize leads and make salespeople more efficient
    - Manufacturing: machine learning can reduce labor costs and improve quality through automated visual inspection
    - Recruiting: data science can optimize recruiting funnel, while machine learning is used for automated resume screening
    - Marketing: data science can optimize website performance through AB testing, while machine learning can provide customized product recommendations
    - Agriculture: data science is used for crop analytics, while precision agriculture is an exciting change made possible by machine learning

### How to choose an AI project (Part 1)

- Select AI projects that are both feasible and valuable for your business.
- Bring together a team comprising both people knowledgeable of AI and experts in your business area to brainstorm projects.
- Identify tasks in your business that may be automatable using machine learning, instead of thinking about automating entire jobs.
- Look for main drivers of business value and main pain points in your business for potential project ideas.
- You can make progress even without big data.

### How to choose an AI project (Part 2)

- Due deligence is essential.
- Technical diligence helps ensure that the AI system can meet the desired level of performance, requires the right amount of data, and determines the engineering timeline.
- Business deligence is also required. To ensure that the AI project adds value to the business, such as lowering costs or increasing revenue, and involves building financial models to estimate the project's value quantitatively.
- Ethical diligence is essential to make sure that the project benefits humanity and society.
- Data science projects are often done in-house due to the deep day-to-day knowledge required about the business.
- Building things that provide a unique defensible advantage is encouraged, whereas things that are industry standard should be bought rather than built in-house.

### Working with an AI team

- Working with a team means to specify things to ensure everyone works towards the right acceptance criteria.
- AI teams use statistical ways to specify their system's performance, usually in percentage accuracy.
- AI teams may need two different test sets for technical reasons.
- A pitfall to avoid is expecting 100% accuracy from the AI software.
